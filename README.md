# ![BasicConfig](https://github.com/Basiiic/BasicConfig/blob/main/logo.png)
My autoexec config and custom folder for Team Fortress 2, using [ComangliaComs](https://github.com/Comanglia/ComangliaComs) and [Shounic's Comanglia Maxframes edit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K3dC6b5oiXVZ_du5rkbXt1ImxMXSvYY7/view?pli=1) as a base.

# Installation
Click on the green code button, select download zip.
extract the tf folder to your tf2 install.
next go to your game properties and set these launch options

-dxlevel 100 -w 1920 -h 1080 -novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -nohltv -particles 1 -precachefontchars -noquicktime
or
-dxlevel 81 -w 1920 -h 1080 -novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -nohltv -particles 1 -precachefontchars -noquicktime

after launching once you can remove the -dxlevel, -w, and -h launch options. (or dont, you dont really have to)
