# BasicConfig
My autoexec config for Team Fortress 2, using [ComangliaComs](https://github.com/Comanglia/ComangliaComs) as a base.

uses some things from other configs, such as [cfg.tf's](https://cfg.tf/) shift + number to join class 

and [Aar's TF2 Essentials](https://aarmastah.xyz/misc/tf2e/) for the null movement and reload action key.
