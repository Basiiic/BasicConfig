///IF YOU ARE COMING FROM BASICCONFIG, THIS HAS NOTHING TODO WITH THE CONFIG IT WAS JUST DOCUMENTATION I MADE FOR MAKING SOUNDS CASUAL COMPATABLE


Pick the folder or the vpk. (vpk preferred in-game, folder preferred for modding)

Install in custom folder.
	Example:
		C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom

Requires Modern Casual Preloader.

IMPORTANT: The !CustomSounds! folder must be installed for custom sounds to work,
assuming you did not install the Sound Utility Script. You must manually add the sounds
from every custom sound you have into this folder for them to work in casual.

Example: Put ("precache_file"		"scripts/game_sounds_classic_m1garand.txt")
at the top of the list in the "game_sounds_manifest.txt" within the scripts folder of
!CustomSounds!: do this for every sound want to have in casual.

//MAKING YOUR OWN SOUND SCRIPT//
-- This part was added by me (basic) --
Firstly, use gcfscape to extract the sound scripts you need from tf_misc_dir
lets say you have sound replacements for a weapon, make a new folder in your custom folder formatted like this:
MyMod/scripts/
MyMod/sound/vo/
(it doesnt have to specifically be called MyMod)
inside the scripts folder make a game_sounds_NAMEHERE.txt the NAMEHERE can be whatever you choose, dont make it any of
tf2's defaults.
now open the game_sounds_weapons.txt and look for the sniper rifle section, lets copy all of that part and paste it
into our game_sounds_NAMEHERE.txt 
now go into that text file, and for every sound you are replacing, add a vo/ before the file path, it should
look something like this:
"Weapon_NAMEHERE"
{
	"channel"		"CHAN_STATIC"
	"soundlevel"	"SNDLVL_74dB"
	"volume"		".5"
	"wave"		"vo/weapons/Sound.wav"
}
now, go to your MyMod/sound/vo/ folder, and we will treat this folder as if it were the main sound directory.
place your weapons sound folder into here, it should have the wav files inside of that folder, it should look like this:
MyMod/sound/vo/weapons/Sound.wav
now your weapon sound will play, but we arent done yet.
go back to your custom folder, and open the !Custom Sounds! folder.
inside the scripts folder, open game_sounds_manifest.txt.
inside of the brackets, add a prechache file line for your custom soundscript you made earlier, make sure it
matches all of the other lines in the script, you should have something like this:
	"precache_file"		"scripts/game_sounds_NAMEHERE.txt"
after that, you should be done! your sound will work in casual!
if you want to, pack the folder into a vpk via the vpk.exe inside of team fortress 2/bin folder or use
crowbar to pack it into vpk instead, to decrease load times
